Some data used in this web tool includes patch-seq data, and single-cell RNAseq used for cell type expression analysis, from the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP-RRID:SCR_016202) Database (https://hpap.pmacs.upenn.edu), a Human Islet Research Network (RRID:SCR_014393) consortium (UC4-DK-112217, U01-DK-123594, UC4-DK-112232, and U01-DK-123716). Consolidation of datasets and web tool development was supported by a research grant funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, JDRF Canada, and Diabetes Canada (5-SRA-2021-1149-S-B/TG 179092) to MacDonald (Alberta), Xia (McGill), Johnson (UBC) and Bruin (Carleton) with collaborators Gloyn (Stanford), Foster (UBC), Atlas (Ottawa), Mulvihill (Ottawa), Lynn (UBC), and Verchere (UBC). 1.4 Overview and Sample/data Collection The purpose of the HumanIslets.com tool is to allow exploration and analysis of, and access to data from, human islet molecular and functional phenotyping studies. We hope this resource will facilitate research and hypothesis generation in a manner that is accessible to both experts and non-experts in data analysis. The below figure illustrates general workflows, samples, and datasets collected as part of this initiative Data noted in blue are currently included within the web tool, while those in grey are are planned for addition at a later date.

These characteristics can come from the family and aren’t always accurate reflections of the medical history. Hba1c measurements are performed in the Isletcore when the donor blood sample is available. 2.3 Organ Characteristics and Processing: Organ characteristic and processing data is recorded during the islet isolation by the lead technician. Cold Ischemia time will be calculated based on the cross clamp time during organ procurement until the start of the isolation in Edmonton. 2.4 Isolation Outcomes: Islet purity, IEQ, % trapped, IPI are determined by the lead technician. Full details on determining IEQ, purity etc can be found here or in our IsletCore welcome booklet. Details on determining Insulin and DNA samples can always be found here. Cell proportion data is determined through our proteomics data. Proteomics samples are shipped to Jim Johnson’s lab at UBC. Samples are then hand picked and snap frozen for processing. 2.5 Cell Culture Outcomes: On the day of shipping, Islets are recounted to determine IEQ, % recovery, IPI after culture. Culture time is determined by the end of the isolation until approximately 9am on a shipping day. Post culture samples are collected for insulin and DNA as previously described. 2.6 Static Insulin Secretion: In triplicates, 15 hand picked islets from each donor were sequentially treated with low glucose for 1 hour followed by high glucose 1 hour. Collected supernatant for low glucose, high glucose or insulin content are measured by ELISA and recorded in the database. For each donor, there are multiple glucose combinations that may have been used. Glucose pairs are 1mM to 10mM glucose, 1mM to 16.7mM glucose or 2.8mM glucose to 16.7mM glucose. Islets used in the 1mM to 10mM group are unique from the 1mM to 16.7mM group. The secretion data are commonly presented as a percentage of the total content (secreted insulin/total insulin *100), and as a stimulation index (high glucose secretion/low glucose secretion). Biological outliers were defined as “Seth is coming up with the definition now”, and identified outliers were removed from the dataset. The data for each replicate (after outlier removal) can be downloaded from the data export page. The total insulin content, secretion percentages, and stimulation indices, averaged across replicates, can be queried, analyzed, and visualized in the other parts of the tool. Complete experimental details can be found here. 2.7 Islet Oxygen Consumption (Seahorse assay): 2.8 Dynamic Insulin Responses to Macronutrients: Human islets are shipped to Jim Johnson’s lab at UBC. Islets are hand picked and cultured in RPMI for 24-72hrs before the experiment to allow the islets to recover from shipping. 65 islets are loaded per chamber and pre-incubated for 1 hour. Islets are stimulated with 6 or 15mM glucose, 5mM Leucine or 0.75mM Oleic acid/0.75mM palmitic acid as indicated. Samples are stored at -20C until analysis with RIA. Full details are described here. 2.9 Single-cell Function (electrophysiology) Human islets are hand picked and dispersed into single cells and plated on 35mm cell culture dishes by the MacDonald lab. 24-72 hours after the dispersion, electrophysiological measurements are recorded. Cell identity is confirmed by immunohistochemistry.
